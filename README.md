# Basics of Database Systems - Course Project | Spring 2023

In this project we created a database which stores information and advanced statistics of NHL players and teams. We also implemented a simple Python interface to demonstrate different database queries.
* [DBreport.pdf](https://github.com/eeroryha/DBS-Harkkaty-/blob/main/DBreport.pdf): the report related to this project.
* [dbinterface.py](https://github.com/eeroryha/DBS-Harkkaty-/blob/main/dbinterface.py): the implemented interface for demonstrating the database queries.
* [sqlcommands.sql](https://github.com/eeroryha/DBS-Harkkaty-/blob/main/sqlcommands.sql): all sql-commands to create the tables and insert the statistics.

The data used in this project was from [MoneyPuck.com](https://moneypuck.com/data.htm).
